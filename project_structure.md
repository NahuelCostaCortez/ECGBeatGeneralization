## Project Overview
This project focuses on ECG (Electrocardiogram) signal analysis and classification using various deep learning approaches, particularly sequence-to-sequence models and CNNs. It incorporates multiple ECG databases (MIT-BIH, NSR, INCART, Icentia11k). The project emphasizes model generalization across different databases and includes comprehensive evaluation metrics for various ECG beat types (N, S, V, F, Q).
